# Welcome to www.chaandbakshi.com!

This project is purely a frontend website. It started off as an experiment with React Three Fiber (R3F) and is my first ever project using R3F. As I started learning more about how to build funtionality out of the framework, I decided to create a small little portfolio website. This is v1.0 of my portfolio website and still has a lot of stuff pending to be added (**most importantly a projects sections**).

I'll soon be adding a projects section once I find inspiration. I'm planning on using a card slider type of component which will display all of my projects.
